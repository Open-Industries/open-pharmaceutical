## Context

Every vertical has one rule whose violation destroys trust in the platform. Making it a tested code invariant — not documentation — is what makes this core a reference implementation.

## Decision

units released from a batch never exceed the batch's available stock — a release that would overrun it is rejected (422) and records nothing; batch disposition is always evidenced. The enforcement lives in the operations context's single write path, and the behavior is covered by automated tests (over-draw rejected with 422; state unchanged).

## Consequences

Callers must treat 422 as a normal business outcome; the API standard documents it.
